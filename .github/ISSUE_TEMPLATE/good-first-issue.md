## 👾 Issue Description

In the `{{module-name}}` module, the `{{ClassName}}` class lacks test coverage for the `{{methodName}}` method.  
This method performs {{brief-description-of-what-it-does}}, but currently has **no unit tests or integration tests** to validate its behavior.

Please test for:
- ✅ Valid input
- ❌ Invalid or missing input
- 🚨 Exception handling (e.g., `{{CustomException}}`)

---

## ✅ Suggested Solution

Create or extend the appropriate test class (e.g., `{{ClassName}}Test`) to add full coverage for the `{{methodName}}` method.

Follow existing testing patterns (likely using **JUnit** or the relevant test framework).  
Ensure to include **positive and negative** test cases.
